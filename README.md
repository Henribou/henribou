I used to be a nuclear engineer : 3 years ago, I decided to reconvert myself and became a Front-End Developer at Ignition Program. After 1 year, I learned Python, Django and DRF and became a Full Stack Developer.

Now, after 3 amazing years at Ignition Program, I left to launch le-parapheur.fr, a tool to help collectivity to deal with their mails and their relation with citizens.
